# Begginers Task 1 - Variables

# 1. Storing Pi value
pi = 22/7
print("pi:", pi, "type:", type(pi))

# 2. Invalid Syntax
# We cannot use 'for' as a variable name because it's reserved
for = 4
print("for:", for)

# 3. Simple Interest calculation
P = 100  # principal amount
R = 2     # rate of interest
T = 4     # time in years
SI = P * R * T / 100
print("Simple Interest for 3 years:", SI)
