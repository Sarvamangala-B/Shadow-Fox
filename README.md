Python Development Internship Tasks – ShadowFox
## Task 1(Beginner)
a. Variables 
1. Create a variable named pi and store the value 22/7 in it.
 Now check the data type of this variable. 
2. Create a variable called for and assign it a value 4. See what
 happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you
 see. 
3. Store the principal amount, rate of interest, and time in
 different variables and then calculate the Simple Interest for 3
 years. Formula: Simple Interest = P x R x T / 100

b. Numbers 
1. Write a function that takes two arguments, 145 and 'o', and
 uses the `format` function to return a formatted string. Print the
 result. Try to identify the representation used. 
2. In a village, there is a circular pond with a radius of 84 meters.
 Calculate the area of the pond using the formula: Circle Area = π
 r^2. (Use the value 3.14 for π) Bonus Question: If there is exactly
 1.4 liters of water in a square meter, what is the total amount of
 water in the pond? Print the answer without any decimal point in
 it. Hint: Circle Area = π r^2 Water in the pond = Pond Area
 Water per Square Meter 
3. If you cross a 490meterlong street in 7 minutes, calculate your
 speed in meters per second. Print the answer without any decimal
 point in it. Hint: Speed = Distance / Time

c. List 
1. You have a list of superheroes representing the Justice
 League. justice_league = ["Superman", "Batman", "Wonder
 Woman", "Flash", "Aquaman", "Green Lantern"] 
Perform the following tasks: 
1. Calculate the number of members in the Justice League. 
2. Batman recruited Batgirl and Nightwing as new members.
 Add them to your list. 
3. Wonder Woman is now the leader of the Justice League.
 Move her to the beginning of the list. 
4. Aquaman and Flash are having conflicts, and you need to
 separate them. Choose either "Green Lantern" or "Superman"
 and move them in between Aquaman and Flash. 
5. The Justice League faced a crisis, and Superman decided to
 assemble a new team. Replace the existing list with the following
 new members: "Cyborg", "Shazam", "Hawkgirl", "Martian
 Manhunter", "Green Arrow". 
6. Sort the Justice League alphabetically. The hero at the 0th
 index will become the new leader. 
(BONUS: Can you predict who the new leader will be?) 
Your task is to write Python code to perform these operations on
 the "justice_league" list. Display the list at each step to observe
 the changes.

d. If Condition 
1. Write a program to determine the BMI Category based on user input. 
Ask the user to: 
Enter height in meters 
Enter weight in kilograms 
Calculate BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height)2 
Use the following categories: 
If BMI is 30 or greater, print "Obesity" 
If BMI is between 25 and 29, print "Overweight" 
If BMI is between 18.5 and 25, print "Normal" 
If BMI is less than 18.5, print "Underweight" 
Example: 
Enter height in meters: 1.75 
Enter weight in kilograms: 70 
Output: "Normal" 
2. Write a program to determine which country a city belongs to. Given
 list of cities per country: 
Australia = ["Sydney", "Melbourne", "Brisbane", "Perth"] 
UAE = ["Dubai", "Abu Dhabi", "Sharjah", "Ajman"] 
India = ["Mumbai", "Bangalore", "Chennai", "Delhi"] 
Ask the user to enter a city name and print the corresponding country.
3. Write a program to check if two cities belong to the same country.
 Ask the user to enter two cities and print whether they belong to the
 same country or not.

e. Dictionary 
1. Create a list of your friends' names. The list should have at least 5 names.
 Create a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain a friend's name and the length
 of the name. 
For example, if someone’s name is Aditya, the tuple would be: ('Aditya', 6).
2. You and your partner are planning a trip, and you want to track expenses.
 Create two dictionaries, one for your expenses and one for your partner's
 expenses. Each dictionary should contain at least 5 expense categories and their
 corresponding amounts

## Task 2(Intermediate Level):
1. Web Scraper: Extract data from websites using libraries like
 Beautiful Soup or Scrapy. 
2. Hangman: Implement the wordguessing game with visual
 progress and hints.
