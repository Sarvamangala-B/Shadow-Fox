Python Development Internship Tasks – ShadowFox
## Task Level (Beginner)
a. Variables 
1. Create a variable named pi and store the value 22/7 in it.
 Now check the data type of this variable. 
2. Create a variable called for and assign it a value 4. See what
 happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you
 see. 
3. Store the principal amount, rate of interest, and time in
 different variables and then calculate the Simple Interest for 3
 years. Formula: Simple Interest = P x R x T / 100

b. Numbers 
1. Write a function that takes two arguments, 145 and 'o', and
 uses the `format` function to return a formatted string. Print the
 result. Try to identify the representation used. 
2. In a village, there is a circular pond with a radius of 84 meters.
 Calculate the area of the pond using the formula: Circle Area = π
 r^2. (Use the value 3.14 for π) Bonus Question: If there is exactly
 1.4 liters of water in a square meter, what is the total amount of
 water in the pond? Print the answer without any decimal point in
 it. Hint: Circle Area = π r^2 Water in the pond = Pond Area
 Water per Square Meter 
3. If you cross a 490meterlong street in 7 minutes, calculate your
 speed in meters per second. Print the answer without any decimal
 point in it. Hint: Speed = Distance / Time

c. List 
1. You have a list of superheroes representing the Justice
 League. justice_league = ["Superman", "Batman", "Wonder
 Woman", "Flash", "Aquaman", "Green Lantern"] 
Perform the following tasks: 
1. Calculate the number of members in the Justice League. 
2. Batman recruited Batgirl and Nightwing as new members.
 Add them to your list. 
3. Wonder Woman is now the leader of the Justice League.
 Move her to the beginning of the list. 
4. Aquaman and Flash are having conflicts, and you need to
 separate them. Choose either "Green Lantern" or "Superman"
 and move them in between Aquaman and Flash. 
5. The Justice League faced a crisis, and Superman decided to
 assemble a new team. Replace the existing list with the following
 new members: "Cyborg", "Shazam", "Hawkgirl", "Martian
 Manhunter", "Green Arrow". 
6. Sort the Justice League alphabetically. The hero at the 0th
 index will become the new leader. 
(BONUS: Can you predict who the new leader will be?) 
Your task is to write Python code to perform these operations on
 the "justice_league" list. Display the list at each step to observe
 the changes.
